# twitter-bot
CREATING DEVELOPER ACCOUNT IN TWITTER:
Twitter API requires that all requests use OAuth in order to authenticate. To create the required authentication credentials to be able to use the API. 
1.	Consumer key
2.	Consumer secret
3.	Access token
4.	Access secret
Step 1: Applying for a Twitter Developer Account "https://developer.twitter.com/en"
Step 2: Creating an application
Step 3: Creating the authentication credentials

We have to register the application to be able to make API calls.
1.	Name of the Application: This information will serve as the name to identify the application (For example, testbot)
2.	Description of the Application: This information will serve as the purpose of the application (For example, test bot to learn about tweepy)
3.	Website URL for the application: This information is required; however, we can use the URL to some personal websites as the bots do not require a URL to function.
4.	Use of the application: This information tells how users will utilize the application (For example, this application is a bot that will automatically respond to users)

And we can then generate the credentials from the app in the developer portal and we can use it in the program.
